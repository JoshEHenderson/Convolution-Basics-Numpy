# Convolution-Basics-Numpy
This is an exploration of the basics of convolution using the Numpy libraries.
It includes implementations of padding, ReLU, max pool, invert img, and convolution.
Enter a file location into the DIR variable and then use the different methods to observe how different layers change an image.
